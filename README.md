# üöÄ Docker-Projects  

This repository contains **Docker practice projects**.  
The applications inside were forked from open-source projects, but the main focus here is on:  

- Writing **Dockerfiles**  
- Building Docker **images**  
- Running applications in **containers**  
- Exposing ports and accessing apps via browser  
- Organizing multiple Dockerized projects in one repo  

Note: I did not develop the base applications. My focus was on creating Dockerfiles and containerizing them as part of my Docker practice.
